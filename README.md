# ToDoList
This is a basic To-Do-List program. Source Code and deployment ready executeable directory included.

The main.py is creating the application with the code within the "src"-directory.
It is automatically creating a SQLite3-Database in the subfolder.

The application is ready for deployment, the required files are within the "ready_to_use"-directory and it was created with "auto-py-to-exe".
